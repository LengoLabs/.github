## Hey! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the Github profile for Lengo Labs. We are a group of developers interested in creating innovative tools for managing your online communities. Currently, we are focusing on our tools for Roblox roleplay groups.

## Cool! What are your projects?
We are most well known for [Qbot](https://github.com/LengoLabs/qbot), an open source Discord-Roblox ranking bot. Qbot also features powerful integrations outside of the Discord bot that allow you to empower your Roblox roleplay group with the powerful tools it needs to manage its users and staff.

## What else?
That's all for now, but stay tuned by [joining our Discord server](https://lengolabs.com/discord), as our team is working on some new projects for Q1 2022 that we think you'll love!
